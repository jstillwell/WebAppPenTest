# WebAppPenTest
App for testing web apps for vulnerabilities like Sql injection, XSS and other.

Make sure the startup project is the WPF UI project and then click start to fire up the proxy. After that all web traffic will be redirected and captured. It will then be displayed in the table at the top of the app. Clicking on a line in the table will show you the headers related to that request/response in the lower view.

I still have a long way to go with this and would love feedback of any kind.

Thanks for taking your time to check it out.
